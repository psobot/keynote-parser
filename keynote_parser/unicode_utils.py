Tools to handle yaml Unicode incompatibilities between Python 2 and 3.

tl;dr: when writing Yaml with emojis in it from Python 2 and reading from
Python 3 (or vice versa),  are incompatibilities with the unicode handling
that result in runtime exceptions. It's Bad.

This file aims to manually do some pre-parsing on the Yaml strings before
decoding to ensure that whichever version of Python is doing the decoding
can successfully parse the string. Since this library now only supports
Python 3, we only need to support reading Python 2-written strings in
Python 3, not vice versa.

Russell Cottrell's wonderful Surrogate Pair Calculator
(http://www.russellcottrell.com/greek/utilities/SurrogatePairCalculator.htm)
has been invaluable in understanding how to do this translation manually,
including the fact that Unicode surrogate pairs are only valid if the first
element is between 0xD800 and 0xDBFF, and the second element is between
0xDC00 and 0xDFFF.
